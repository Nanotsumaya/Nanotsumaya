Hi, 

This is actually not my first GitHub account, and I am known on GitHub for other projects,
but here at this account I can host repositories, which may be some kind of illegal or in a grey zone. 
You'll find APIs, Aimbots, Ransomware and other stuff here.

Unfortunately, I can't show you my name or my real username.


This account was created using a completely different IP address with a VPN
and a highly secured mail account which was also created with a fake identity  and
is secured by military encryption and Multi-factor authentication.



In my personal opinion, no Open-Source project should be illegal, and that's why
I publish them here.

if copyright holders come to GitHub and make a claim to take something down, I of course
can't say No and have to follow that, but I want to at least avoid legal consequences in 
real life.


Usually Open-Source projects are financed by the community, and even if you don't make money with a project, you can still
earn popularity and credibility in the Open-Source community and on GitHub in general.

Since I can't stand with my real name for the projects and therefore can't make anything out of it, I'd be happy
if you could donate me some Monero here:
